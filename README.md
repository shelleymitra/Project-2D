My scientific question is: Does VEGF’s non-heparin binding site for pro-angiogenic activity exhibit similar nucleotide sequences, amino acid residues, acidic/basic properties to the thrombospondin’s heparin binding domain, given that these proteins exerts different effects on the same mechanism? Do the overall structures exhibit such similarity?The scientific question is: Angiogenesis refers to the formation of blood vessels that promotes cancerous cell growth and migration. While VEGF promotes angiogenesis, thrombospondin can prevent it via its heparin-binding site. Does VEGF exhibit similar nucleotide sequences and protein structures to thrombospondin’s heparin-binding domain, given that these proteins work on the same biological mechanism? Do the overall structures exhibit such similarity?
