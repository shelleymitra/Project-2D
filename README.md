Angiogenesis refers to the formation of blood vessels that promote cancerous cell growth and migration. In humans, VEGF promotes angiogenesis while thrombospondin (TSP) inhibits it (Lugano 2020). TSP exerts its anti-angiogenic effects by either binding to VEGF directly, or by binding to heparin sulfates (Gupta 1999), which means that TSP largely exerts its anti-angiogenic effects via its heparin-binding domain. Heparin binding domains have a substantial amount of basic residues, such as lysine, arginine, and histidine (Munoz 2004). While VEGF has a heparin binding domain as well, only about 35% of mitogenic activity is due to this region, leaving the other 65% of angiogenic activity unaccounted for (Gupta 1999).


My scientific question is: Does VEGF’s non-heparin binding site for pro-angiogenic activity exhibit similar nucleotide sequences, amino acid residues, acidic/basic properties to the thrombospondin’s heparin binding domain, given that these proteins exerts different effects on the same mechanism? Do the overall structures exhibit such similarity?


My hypothesis is: If VEGF exerts most of its angiogenic activity by its non-heparin binding domain, then this domain will have differing sequences and properties in terms of acidity and basicity when compared to TSP's heparin domain because these two proteins exert opposite effects on angiogenesis. Likewise, if these molecules exert opposite effects on the same mechanism, then their overall structures will differ greatly despite the fact that they should have conserved heparin binding domains.


Two PDB files were uploaded: vegfhuman.pdb and tsp_heparin.pdb. These PDB files were used for 3D structural measurements and RMSDs and PCAs. veg.human.pdb is a pdb file of the vegf protein found in humans. This promotes angiogenesis. Tsp_heparin.pdb is a pdb file containing thrombospondin complexed with heparin. 

Two fasta files were uploaded: vegf_fasta and tsp_fasta. These fastas were used for the pairwise sequence alignment. Vegf_fasta is a fasta file representing the vegf gene, which is responsible for promoting angiogenesis. tsp_fasta is a fasta file that represents the full TSP gene, which is responsible for preventing angiogenedis.
